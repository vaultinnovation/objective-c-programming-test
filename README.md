#  Vault Innovation iOS Interview Test

Thanks for applying at Vault!

The tests in this exercise shouldn't take more than a hour or so to complete.

## Instructions

This project uses cocoapods; please install the dependencies before
continuing.

Load the project from VaultCodeTest.xcworkspace.

### Part 1

When you press the "Reverse String" button in the UI, the app should 
reverse the user-provided string.

1. Write a string reversal routine.
2. Using this routine, make the tests in VaultCodeTestTests.m and
   VaultCodeTestUITest.m pass.
3. Set up the UI such that when you press "Reverse String" it takes the text from textSrc, reverses it, and places it in textDest.

### Part 2

When you press the "Load Image" button in the UI, the app should load a cat
image and display it.

1. Change the constraints on the uiimageview such that it fills the remainder of
   the screen.
2. Use the AFNetworking library to retrieve an image from http://thecatapi.com/
3. Load the image into the uiimageview when the button is pressed
